# BeatDrop

BeatDrop Shuffle is a MERN stack rewrite of the original BeatDrop project that we created as a final project on the Northcoders full-stack development bootcamp.

The original project is available here - [BeatDrop](https://github.com/BeatDropNC/BeatDrop)  - and was created by Atlas Sproson, Alex Evans (Me), Jack Marsden, James Jinks, and Sachin Naranji. 


# BeatDrop Shuffle

Beatdrop Shuffle is a vertical scrolling game where the player has to dodge platforms, collect power-ups and avoid power-downs to try and achieve the highest score.

You can track your progress on the leaderboard and compare your own scores to the world records for each level.
